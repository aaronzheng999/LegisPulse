# LegisPulse

LegisPulse tracks Georgia legislative bills and provides AI-generated bill analysis. Built for Georgia legislative staff and advocates to monitor bill activity, track legislation of interest, share bills with teammates, and get instant AI summaries of bill changes.

## Current Capabilities

- **User accounts** — register, log in, and log out with email/password (powered by Supabase Auth)
- **Per-user data** — tracked bills, email lists, and notifications are stored in a cloud database, tied to your account
- **Team collaboration** — create a team, invite colleagues by email, share bills across the team
- **Team chat** — real-time messaging between team members with emoji, file/image attachments, drag-and-drop upload, and auto-expiry after 2½ weeks
- **LC number tracking (all bills)** — a background scraper keeps the LC (Legislative Counsel) number for every bill in the session up to date from legis.ga.gov, with change notifications
- **Comparison tab** — compare two bill versions/substitutes side-by-side with an AI-generated summary of additions, removals, and modifications, plus authoritative per-version LC numbers and chamber labels
- **Calendar** — Georgia committee meeting schedule pulled from legis.ga.gov
- **Committees** — browse committees, members, and assigned bills
- **Twitter/X feed** — embedded legislative news feed
- **Account profile & settings** — display name, username, and avatar upload
- Sync Georgia bills from LegiScan (full session, 4000+ bills via paginated fetch)
- Auto-sync on first load when no bills are in the database
- Show newest bills first (higher bill number first)
- Search by bill number/text with improved exact matching (e.g. `HB10` and `HB 10`)
- Track/untrack bills — persisted to your account across devices
- Add/remove bills to your team's shared list
- Open direct bill PDFs (uses LegiScan `getBillText` flow when available)
- Fetch and display sponsor lists (cards + details)
- Generate and regenerate AI summaries from bill text context (`summary` + `changes_analysis`)
- Instant tab navigation — data is cached in memory so switching pages does not reload from the server
- Scroll position and "load more" count are remembered when navigating away from Dashboard

## Team Feature

Each user belongs to exactly one team. The owner can invite other registered users by email.

### Flow

1. **Owner** goes to the **Team** tab → sees their team name, member list, and invite form
2. **Owner** invites a colleague by entering their email and clicking **Invite**
3. **Invited user** goes to the **Team** tab → sees a **"Team Invitation"** screen with Accept / Decline buttons
4. After accepting, the invited user sees the owner's team and all shared bills
5. Owner can remove any member using the trash icon
6. Members can leave the team via the **Leave Team** button

### Database tables

- `teams` — one row per team (`id`, `name`, `created_by`)
- `team_members` — join table (`team_id`, `user_id`, `email`, `role`, `status`)
- `team_bills` — shared bills (`team_id`, `bill_number`)
- `team_chat_messages` — chat messages (`team_id`, `user_id`, `message`, attachment columns, `created_at`)

### RPC functions (security definer — bypass RLS)

| Function                              | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `my_team_ids()`                       | Returns team IDs the caller owns or is active in (used in RLS policies) |
| `get_my_pending_invites()`            | Returns pending invites for the caller's email                          |
| `accept_my_team_invites()`            | Accepts all pending invites for the caller                              |
| `decline_my_team_invite(invite_id)`   | Declines a specific pending invite                                      |
| `remove_team_member(member_id)`       | Owner removes a member from their team                                  |
| `leave_my_team(p_team_id)`            | Member leaves a team they joined                                        |     | `get_my_team_ids()` | Returns team IDs the caller belongs to (used by chat RLS) |
| `get_team_member_profiles(p_team_id)` | Returns profile info for all members of a team                          |
| `get_team_chat_messages(p_team_id)`   | Returns chat messages with sender info (security definer)               |
| `send_team_chat_message(...)`         | Inserts a chat message with optional attachment fields                  |
| `cleanup_old_chat_messages()`         | Deletes messages older than 2½ weeks (runs via pg_cron every 6 hours)   |

## Team Chat

Real-time chat embedded in the Team page. All operations use `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs to avoid RLS recursion.

### Features

- **Real-time messaging** — uses Supabase Realtime (`postgres_changes`) for instant delivery
- **Emoji picker** — powered by `@emoji-mart/react`; click the smiley icon to browse and insert emoji
- **File & image attachments** — click the paperclip icon or drag-and-drop a file (max 10 MB) onto the chat card
- **Inline image preview** — image attachments render as thumbnails in the message bubble
- **File download** — non-image attachments show as a card with filename, size, and a download button
- **2-minute delete window** — you can only delete your own messages within 2 minutes of sending
- **Auto-expiry** — a `pg_cron` job runs every 6 hours and deletes messages older than 2½ weeks
- **Optimistic UI** — messages appear instantly while uploading/sending

### Storage

Attachments are uploaded to a Supabase Storage bucket named `team-chat-files`. Storage policies allow any authenticated user to upload, anyone to read, and only the uploader to delete their own files.

Run each migration in the Supabase **SQL Editor** in order.

## LC Number Tracking (all bills)

Every bill on legis.ga.gov carries an internal **LC (Legislative Counsel) number** for each drafted version/substitute (e.g. `LC 33 9902S/RCS`). LegisPulse keeps the current LC number for **all ~5,480 bills** in the session continuously up to date so cards and the Comparison tab can display and diff them.

### How it works

- The scraper lives in [`server/lcRecheck.js`](server/lcRecheck.js) and runs **server-side on the Node host** (`npm start` → `server.js`). It must run from a US cloud host (e.g. Render) because legis.ga.gov firewalls Supabase edge IPs and most non-US egress.
- It enumerates every bill via `POST /api/Legislation/Search`, then reads `GET /api/legislation/Detail/{id}` and extracts the newest LC number from the `versions[]` list.
- Results are written to the global `bill_lc_history` table (one row per bill, with `legislation_id` bridging back to legis.ga.gov). Changed LC numbers are mirrored into the per-user `bills.lc_number` column.
- Work is **incremental** — a bill is only re-fetched when it is new or its status date advanced — so steady-state runs are fast.

### Endpoint & scheduler (`server.js`)

| Route                            | Behavior                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/lc-recheck`           | Run a recheck (default `90000` ms budget), returns a JSON summary |
| `POST /api/lc-recheck?budget=0`  | Run unbounded (full backfill of every bill)                       |
| `POST /api/lc-recheck?budget=ms` | Run with a custom wall-clock budget in milliseconds               |

- Protected by an `x-recheck-secret` request header when `LC_RECHECK_SECRET` is set.
- A scheduler (`startLcRecheckScheduler`) runs an unbounded pass ~20 s after boot and then every `LC_RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (default 1 hour). Concurrent runs are serialised — a second call returns `{ skipped: true, reason: "already running" }`.
- Also proxies `POST /api/openstates-graphql` → `https://openstates.org/graphql`.

### `LcTracking` API (`src/api/apiClient.js`)

| Method                                  | Purpose                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getAll()`                              | Merged LC map for the user's tracked + team bills (includes change-notification state)  |
| `getGlobalLcMap()`                      | Lightweight `{ bill_number → current_lc }` for **every** bill (used by the dashboard)   |
| `getLegislationId(billNumber)`          | Resolve the legis.ga.gov `legislation_id` for a bill (bridge to the version detail API) |
| `getUnseenCount()`                      | Count of unseen LC changes for the current user                                         |
| `markAllSeen()` / `markBillsSeen(nums)` | Acknowledge LC change notifications                                                     |
| `batchUpsert(entries)`                  | Write LC numbers to the global history + bump the user's `last_checked`                 |

## Comparison Tab

The **Comparison** page (`src/pages/Comparison.jsx`) compares bill versions and substitutes with an AI-generated summary. It has four modes: **Versions** (two versions of one bill), **Two Bills**, **Across Years**, and **By Topic**.

### Hybrid data sourcing

The authoritative version list (with exact LC numbers and chamber labels) comes from **legis.ga.gov**, while the actual bill **text** fed to the AI comes from **LegiScan** (which exposes clean full text). The two are matched by recency so each version shows its own LC number while the diff runs on reliable text.

- `src/services/legisGa.js` → `fetchBillVersionsGa(legislationId)` returns LC-bearing versions oldest-first as `{ versionNumber, name, lc, chamber, isCurrent }` (floor amendments without an LC are filtered out).
- `src/services/legiscan.js` comparison helpers:
  - `getGASessions()` — cached session list (newest first) for the year picker
  - `fetchGABillsLite(sessionId)` — lean master list for fast search (cached per session)
  - `searchGABills(query, sessionId, limit)` — scored search by bill number/title
  - `findBillInSession(billNumber, sessionId)` — cross-year bill lookup
  - `fetchBillTextVersionsForAI(id, count, maxLen)` — extracted text for the N newest versions
  - `fetchNewestBillText(id)` — newest usable text body for a bill
- The AI summary is produced by `api.integrations.Core.InvokeLLM` and returns `{ chamber, chamber_note, added[], removed[], modified[], summary }`.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI (shadcn/ui components)
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database + Row Level Security + Auth + Realtime + Storage
- **@tanstack/react-query** — client-side data caching (5-minute stale time, shared cache keys)
- **@emoji-mart/react** — emoji picker for team chat
- **Node HTTP server** (`server.js`) — serves the static build, proxies OpenStates GraphQL, and hosts the LC-recheck scraper/scheduler (`server/lcRecheck.js`)
- **LegiScan API** — bill master lists, sponsors, and version text
- **legis.ga.gov API** — authoritative LC numbers, versions, committees, and meeting calendar
- `src/api/apiClient.js` — unified data layer over Supabase + OpenAI

## Environment Variables

Create a local `.env` file (gitignored):

```env
VITE_LEGISCAN_API_KEY=your_legiscan_key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
VITE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### Server-side variables (LC scraper)

These are **not** `VITE_*` and are only read by the Node host (`server.js` / `server/lcRecheck.js`). Set them on the deployment that runs `npm start` (e.g. Render):

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
LC_RECHECK_SECRET=a_long_random_string          # gates POST /api/lc-recheck
LC_RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS=3600000                  # optional, default 1 hour
```

The scraper is disabled automatically when `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are absent.

Get your Supabase URL and anon key from **Project Settings → API** in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

## Database Setup

### Step 1 — Run the migration

Run `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` once in your Supabase project's **SQL Editor**. This creates:

- `profiles` — one row per user, stores `tracked_bill_ids` (jsonb array)
- `bills` — full bill records synced from LegiScan
- `teams`, `team_members`, `team_bills` — team collaboration tables
- `email_lists`, `notifications`, `tweets` — supporting tables
- Row Level Security policies so users only access their own data
- Trigger to auto-create a profile row when a new user registers

### Step 2 — Create RPC functions

Run the following in your Supabase **SQL Editor** to create the security definer functions needed for team features:

```sql
-- Breaks RLS recursion between teams ↔ team_members
create or replace function public.my_team_ids()
returns setof uuid language sql security definer stable as $$
  select id from public.teams where created_by = auth.uid()
  union
  select team_id from public.team_members where user_id = auth.uid()
$$;

-- Pending invite helpers
drop function if exists public.get_my_pending_invites();
create or replace function public.get_my_pending_invites()
returns table(id uuid, team_id uuid, invite_email text, role text, status text, team_name text)
language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  return query
    select tm.id, tm.team_id, tm.email, tm.role, tm.status, t.name
    from public.team_members tm
    join public.teams t on t.id = tm.team_id
    where lower(tm.email) = lower((select u.email from auth.users u where u.id = auth.uid()))
      and tm.status = 'pending';
end;
$$;

create or replace function public.accept_my_team_invites()
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  update public.team_members
  set user_id = auth.uid(), status = 'active'
  where lower(email) = lower((select email from auth.users where id = auth.uid()))
    and status = 'pending';
end;
$$;

create or replace function public.decline_my_team_invite(invite_id uuid)
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from public.team_members
  where id = invite_id
    and lower(email) = lower((select email from auth.users where id = auth.uid()))
    and status = 'pending';
end;
$$;

create or replace function public.remove_team_member(member_id uuid)
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from public.team_members
  where id = member_id
    and team_id in (select id from public.teams where created_by = auth.uid());
end;
$$;

create or replace function public.leave_my_team(p_team_id uuid)
returns void language plpgsql security definer as $$
begin
  delete from public.team_members
  where team_id = p_team_id
    and user_id = auth.uid()
    and role = 'member';
end;
$$;
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build      # produce the static dist/ bundle
npm start          # run the Node server (serves dist/, API proxy, LC scraper)
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
npm run typecheck
```

> `npm run dev` (Vite) does **not** run the LC scraper or API proxy. Use `npm run build && npm start` to exercise the Node server locally, though the scraper itself cannot reach legis.ga.gov from most non-US networks.

## Deploying

The Vite static build can deploy to **Vercel** or **Netlify**. However, the **LC-number scraper requires a Node host** that runs `npm start` (`server.js`) — deploy to **Render** (or a similar US-based Node host) so the scheduler and `POST /api/lc-recheck` endpoint can reach legis.ga.gov.

Add these environment variables in your hosting dashboard:

- `VITE_LEGISCAN_API_KEY`
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- optional `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL`
- optional `VITE_OPENAI_BASE_URL`

For the LC scraper (Node host only): `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `LC_RECHECK_SECRET`, optional `LC_RECHECK_INTERVAL_MS`.

## Security Warning (Important)

Because this is a Vite client app, all `VITE_*` variables are bundled into the client bundle and visible to end users. Supabase Row Level Security ensures each user can only read and write their own data even if the anon key is exposed. For the OpenAI key, consider moving AI calls to a backend/serverless function for production use.
